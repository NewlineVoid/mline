# mline
An emmet-like roblox studio plugin that can help you write lua faster via macros. Type in "gs:rs=RunServ" and watch it become "local RunServ = game:GetService('RunService')" when you press tab. Not sure any of the macros? Type "mlinedebug:false" and tab for a full list of macros, their purpose, and examples. Incomplete/dev build.  V0.1.0
