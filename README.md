# mline
An open-source emmet-like roblox studio plugin that can help you write lua faster via macros.
Type in `gs:rs=RunServ` and watch it become `local RunServ = game:GetService('RunService')` when you press tab.

Not sure any of the macros?
Type `mlinedebug:false` and tab for a full list of macros, their purpose, and examples.

In-development. Current latest version: v0.1.0-alpha

## Known Issues:
As of release, I personally have not discovered any issues. However my testing only goes so far and I would appreciate any constructive criticism as well bug-reports and suggestions.
The primary issue to take note of is during installation, you'll be prompted with a message asking to allow the plugin the permission to manage scripts(or along those lines). I'm not entirely sure if this issue is an one-off thing or may occur to everyone, however sometimes the studio output might show that the permission was denied, even if you did accept it. As far as I know, restarting studio should fix this.

## Future Additions:
- Customizable macros through widget
- im running out of ideas (suggestions appreciated)
