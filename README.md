# mline
An open-source emmet-like roblox studio plugin that can help you write lua faster via macros.
Type in "gs:rs=RunServ" and watch it become "local RunServ = game:GetService('RunService')" when you press tab.
Not sure any of the macros? Type "mlinedebug:false" and tab for a full list of macros, their purpose, and examples.
Incomplete/dev build.
